And was developed in response to <a href="https://2021.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/statements/warning-things-are-heating-up">NASA International Space Apps Challenge</a> / <a href="https://2021.spaceappschallenge.org/locations/casablanca/">Casablanca</a>

## :pushpin: About
Using Earth Observations (EO) and other models (e.g. Sensors...) together with local crowdsourced data our webapp will provide warnings (e.g., heat stress intensity duration levels, potentiel fire), estimate potential human and environmental/ecological impacts, and provide guidance on mitigation measures that are adopted at the individual and national policy levels.
Our web app is will also be available as a Mobile App.

## :pushpin: Process

1. Collect various types of data: the source code and the details of what and how the data was collected can be found in <a href="https://github.com/usmhic/Warmning/blob/main/data/">data</a>.
2. Analyze, mix and visualize the data: the source code and the details of how the data was analyzed, mixed and visualized can also be found in both <a href="https://github.com/usmhic/Warmning/blob/main/data">data</a> and <a href="https://github.com/usmhic/Warmning/blob/main/src/">src</a> base on the datatype.
3. Code the data to be available in the user interface: the source code and the details of how the data was coded can be found in a <a href="https://github.com/usmhic/Warmning/blob/main/src">src</a>.
4. The user interface demo can be found detailed in <a href="https://github.com/usmhic/Warmning/blob/main/sample">sample</a> or simply visit https://warmning.co/
