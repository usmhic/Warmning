The system is a base for sending data to our project database so that it can be used in the application and the website. The system is able to calculate temperature and humidity and perform a calculation to find the heat stress.
The purpose of using it (along with other tools to do the same process) is that the system gives more accurate data than the currently used systems and the speed of response (renewing data every 3 seconds).
So the system is temperature and humidity sensors;  It is possible to use hundreds of them (in our model we used two sensors) the data is sent to the Arduino and then it is analyzed, processed and calculated and then sent to an application on the phone and the information appears on the application with its location
