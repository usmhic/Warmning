# Hardware

Now each type of data gathering tool has it own pros and cons. The data gathered from sensors, drones and cameras is the fastest to respond but also the most expensive.

In this folder you'll find multiple data extraction methods using sensors, drones and cameras. In addition to a heat stress calculator system our team been able to work on: https://github.com/usmhic/Warmning/blob/main/data/hardware/heatstress_calculator_using_sensors

All the data gathered from hardware will be sent to our servers to be analyzed and mixed with the other types of data.
