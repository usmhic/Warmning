In order to show data, we need to gather data. This repo contains all types of data gathered, how it was obtainedand why.

Each type of data has it own cons and pros. The best most accurate is the hardware dataWe mainly focused on 3 types of data

This type of data is detected manually via sensors and drones. We managed to work on a simple prototype that detects temperature level using a temperature sensor and humidity level using a humidity sensor. Then calculate the heat stress using based on the heat stress index mathematical model.
The constant read data is sent to a near by device via Bluetooth or Wifi. Then uploaded to our servers to be analysed, visualized and mixed with other data.

### :pushpin: Crowdsourced
A lot of people nowadays use social media more than any other classical ways of communication. What's good about social networks in this case is that sometimes they give instant information by present people before it's officially reported. For example if there was fire nearby someone he might just after calling the emergency pull out his smart phone and stream live the incident or just tweet about it or send it to a local media platform.


### :pushpin: Earth Observations
In Additionn to other data, Earth Observations give a global more general view of the incident and using ai it can help predict future incident via learning from patterns.
