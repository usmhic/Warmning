WARNING: THINGS ARE HEATING UP!

We have a prObLeM: Climate Change \> Heat \> Social, Economical,
Environmental… Problems \> Lack of Action Plans \>  DING DING!!!

Climate Hackers have a solution!!!

Using this: Earth Observations (EO): Nouhaila /Oussama

Local Crowdsourced Data: Acile

Models: Akram using Hardware (Drones, Sensors...) & Salma  /Oussama
using Software ()

Open Source/NASA

Do this:

-   Warnings: Potential heat-related impacts, Heat stress intensity
    duration levels...
-   Estimate potential human and environmental/ecological impacts.
-   Guidance on mitigation measures that could be adopted at the
    individual and state/national policy levels.

Like this Laptop/smartphone apps (web app (Wordpress Salma),
android/windows app (coming soon) (Adobe xd)...)

-   Generate a heat stress risk warning level (Red, Yellow, Green) for a
    selected area (e.g., city, county, country).
-   Potential risk for the following: forest fires, air pollution, crop
    damage, water and energy supply shortages.
-   Simple intuitive user interface.
-   Require data that is readily available to the user before a risk
    level can be estimated and displayed.

To consider:

-   Simple tabular (quantitative) and graphical displays with brief
    explanations are desirable.
-   Details can be provided as appended or linked cross-references

To add:

-   Quantum computing for fast data analysis in urgent situations
-   AI use
-   Business model to finance the projects
-   User Friendly (Game style or extended to a game)
-   Charity Options

TODO:

-   Show Heat stress (equation) risk warning level (Red, Yellow, Green)
    for a selected area (e.g., city, county, country) + Intensity
    duration levels… using eo, cs and h.
-   Potential human and environmental/ecological impacts:

-   Potentiel forest fire layer + Active fire (Red: Actual fire, Yellow:
    Potentiel fire) using previous and h (Sensors, Drones...)
-   Potentiel crop damage...
-   Potentiel Water Shortage..
-   Energy Supply Shortages...
-   Potentiel Air pollution...
-   Energy Supply Shortages...
-   ...

-   Guidance on mitigation measures that could be adopted at the
    individual and state/national policy levels: App Notification:
