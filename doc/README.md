### :pushpin: Using this
1. Earth Observations (EO), Local Crowdsourced Data, Hardware (Drones, Sensors...) along with other open source data.

### :pushpin: Do this
1. Warnings: Potential heat-related impacts, Heat stress intensity duration levels...
2. Estimate potential human and environmental/ecological impacts.
3. Guidance on mitigation measures that could be adopted at the individual and state/national policy levels.

### :pushpin: Like this
1. Generate a heat stress risk warning level (Red, Yellow, Green) for a selected area (e.g., city, county, country).
2. Potential risk for the following: forest fires, air pollution, crop damage, water and energy supply shortages.
3. Simple intuitive user interface.
4. Require data that is readily available to the user before a risk level can be estimated and displayed.

### :pushpin: Consider this
1. Simple tabular (quantitative) and graphical displays with brief explanations are desirable.
2. Details can be provided as appended or linked cross-references.

### :pushpin: Add this
1. Quantum computing and Machine Learning use for fast and accurate data analysis.
2. Business model to finance the projects.

## :star: Our Solution will Provide

### :pushpin: Interactive map with multiple layers
1. Show Heat stress (equation) risk warning level (Red, Yellow, Green) for a selected area (e.g., city, county, country)
Intensity duration levels… using earth observations, crowdsourcing and hardware.
2. Potential human and environmental/ecological impacts
Potential forest fire layer + Active fire (Red: Actual fire, Yellow: Potential fire) using previous and h (Sensors, Drones...)
3. Potential crop damage, Water and Energy Supply Shortages
4. Potential Air pollution.

### :pushpin: Interactive Emergency Guidance and a Notification System
1. Show guidance on mitigation measures that could be adopted at the individual and state/national policy levels.
2. Provide Notification of places to avoid during certain periods of the day via mobile app, SMS or Email.
