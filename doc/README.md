Disclaimer: This project is currently under construction. Some features might not be fully functional.

### :pushpin: Using this
Earth Observations (EO), Local Crowdsourced Data, Hardware (Drones, Sensors...) along with other open source data.

### :pushpin: Do this

Warnings: Potential heat-related impacts, Heat stress intensity duration levels...

Estimate potential human and environmental/ecological impacts.

Guidance on mitigation measures that could be adopted at the individual and state/national policy levels.

### :pushpin: Like this

Generate a heat stress risk warning level (Red, Yellow, Green) for a selected area (e.g., city, county, country).

Potential risk for the following: forest fires, air pollution, crop damage, water and energy supply shortages.

Simple intuitive user interface.

Require data that is readily available to the user before a risk level can be estimated and displayed.

### :pushpin: Consider this

Simple tabular (quantitative) and graphical displays with brief explanations are desirable.

Details can be provided as appended or linked cross-references
